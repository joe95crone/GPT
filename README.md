# GPT
The GPT input files and batch files as well as the GPT parsers and other code related to GPT activities.

The GPT Parser in Mathematica parses from ascii files. Remember that the -w 16 flag is set in gdf2a for double precision.  

The data for the GPT runs such as the ascii files and the gdf files is stored locally as it is very large.

So far this code is just the code for the EUV coherent ICS simulations. Pete's EUV coherent ICS notebook is also in here.
